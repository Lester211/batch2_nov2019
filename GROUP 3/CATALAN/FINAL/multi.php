 "story" => "THE OTHER DAY a poet friend of mine, 
 <br>
 who has lived in close
 <br>
communication with nature all his life,
<br>
 wrote a poem and took it
to an editor. 
<br>
It was a living pastoral, 
<br>
full of the genuine breath of the fields,
<br>
the song of birds, and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams.
<br>
When the poet called again to see about it, with hopes of a
<br>
beefsteak dinner in his heart, it was handed back to him with the
comment:
<br>
'Too artificial.'
<br>
Several of us met over spaghetti and Dutchess County chianti,
<br>
and swallowed indignation with the slippery forkfuls.
<br>
And there we dug a pit for the editor. With us was Conant, <br>
a well-arrived writer of fiction - a man who had trod on asphalt all
his life,
<br> 
and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with
<br>
sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains.
<br>
Conant wrote a poem and called it 'The Doe and the Brook.
<br>
It's was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a
<br>
poet who had strayed with Amaryllis only as far as the florist's
<br>
windows, and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a waiter.
<br> Conant signed this poem, and we sent it to
the same editor.
<br>
But this has very little to do with the story.
<br>
Just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem,
<br>
on the next morning, a being stumbled off the West Shore ferryboat, 
<br>
andloped slowly up Forty-second Street.
<br>
The invader was a young man with light blue eyes, a hanging. 
<br>
lip, and hair the exact colour of the little orphan's 
<br>
(afterward discovered to be the earl's daughter) in one of Mr. Blaney's plays.
<br>
His trousers were corduroy, his coat short-sleeved, 
<br>
with buttons in the middle of his back. 
<br>One bootleg was outside the corduroys.
 <br>
You looked expectantly, though in vain, at his straw hat for ear-holes,
<br>
its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from
a former equine possessor.
<br>
 In his hand was a valise - description of
it is an impossible task;
<br>
 a Boston man would not have carried his
lunch and law books to his office in it. 
<br>
And above one ear, in his
hair, was a wisp of hay - the rustic's letter of credit,
<br>
 his badge of innocence, the last clinging touch of 
 <br>the Garden of Eden lingering
to shame the goldbrick men.
<br>
Knowingly, smilingly, the city crowds passed him by.
<br>
They saw the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch
<br> his neck at the tall
buildings. 
<br>
At this they ceased to smile, and even to look at him.
<br> It
had been done so often. 
<br>
A few glanced at the antique valise to see
what Coney 'attraction' 
<br>
or brand of chewing-gum he might be
thus dinning into his memory.
<br> But for the most part he was
ignored. 
<br>
Even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like
<br>
a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street-cars.
<br>
At Eighth Avenue stood 'Bunco Harry,' with his dyed moustache and shiny,
<br>
 good-natured eyes. Harry was too good an artist
 <br>
not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part. 
<br> 
He edged up to the countryman, who had stopped to open his mouth
<br>
at a jewellery store window, and shook his head.
<br>
'Too thick, pal,' he said critically - 'too thick by a couple of
inches.
<br>
 I don't know what your lay is; but you've got the properties
on too thick. 
<br>
That hay, now - why, they don't even allow that on
Proctor's circuit any more.'
<br>
'I don't understand you, mister,' said the green one.
<br>
'I'm notlookin' for any circus. I've just run down from Ulster County to
look at the town,
<br>
 bein' that the hayin's over with. Gosh! but it's a
whopper.
<br>
 I thought Poughkeepsie was some punkins; but this here
town is five times as big.'
<br>
'Oh, well,' said 'Bunco Harry,' raising his eyebrows, 'I didn't
mean to butt in.
<br>
 You don't have to tell. I thought you ought to
 <br>
tone down a little, so I tried to put you wise.
<br>
Wish you success at your graft, whatever it is. Come and have a drink, anyhow.'
<br>
'I wouldn't mind having a glass of lager beer,' acknowledged the
other.
<br>
They went to a caf√© frequented by men with smooth faces and
<br>
shifty eyes, and sat at their drinks. 
'I'm glad I come across you, mister,' said Haylocks. 
<br>'How'd you
like to play a game or two of seven-up?
<br> I've got the keerds.'
He fished them out of Noah's valise - a rare, 
<br> inimitable deck,
greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields.
<br>
'Bunco Harry' laughed loud and briefly.
<br>
'Not for me, sport,' he said firmly. 
<br>'I don't go against that
make-up of yours for a cent. 
<br>But I still say you've overdone it. 
<br>The
Reubs haven't dressed like that since '79.
<br> I doubt if you could
work Brooklyn for a key-winding watch with that lay-out.'
<br>
'Oh, you needn't think I ain't got the money,' boasted Haylocks.
<br> He drew forth a tightly rolled mass or bills as large as a
<br>
teacup, and laid it on the table.
<br>
'Got that for my share of grandmother's farm,' 
<br>he announced.
'There's $950 in that roll. 
<br>
Thought I'd come into the city and
<br>
look around for a likely business to go into.'
<br>
'Bunco Harry' took up the roll of money and looked at it with
<br>
almost respect in his smiling eyes.
<br>
'I've seen worse,' he said critically. 
<br>'But you'll never do it in
them clothes.
<br> You want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and
<br>
a straw hat with a coloured band, 
<br>and talk a good deal about Pittsburg and freight differentials, 
<br>
and drink sherry for breakfast in
<br>
order to work off phony stuff like that.
<br>
'What's his line?' asked two or three shifty-eyed men of 
<br>'Bunco
Harry' after Haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and
departed.
<br>
'The queer, I guess,' said Harry. 'Or else he's one of Jerome's
<br>
men. Or some guy with a new graft. 
<br>He's too much hayseed. Maybe that his - I wonder now - oh no,
<br> it couldn't have been real money.'
Haylocks wandered on.
<br> Thirst probably assailed him again, for
he dived into a dark
<br>
groggery on a side-street and bought beer.
<br>
Several sinister fellows hung upon one end of the bar. 
<br>At first sight of him their eyes brightened; 
but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became 
<br>
apparent their expressions changed to wary
suspicion.
<br>
Haylocks swung his valise across the bar.
<br>
'Keep that awhile for me, mister,' he said, chewing at the end of
<br>
a virulent claybank cigar. 'I'll be back after I knock around a spell.
<br>
And keep your eye on it, for there's $950 inside of it, though
<br>
maybe you wouldn't think so to look at me.'
<br>
Somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece, 
<br>and
Haylocks was off for it, 
<br>
his coat-tail buttons flopping in the middle
of his back.
<br>
'Divvy? Mike,' said the men hanging upon the bar, winking
openly at one another.
<br>
'Honest, now,' said the bartender, kicking the valise to one side.
<br>
'You don't think I'd fall to that, do you? 
Anybody can see he ain't
no jay.
<br> One of McAdoo's come-on squad, I guess. 
<br>He's a shine if
he made himself up. 
<br>There ain't no parts of the country now
<br>
where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to
Providence, Rhode Island.
<br> If he's got nine-fifty in that valise it's a
<br>
ninety-eight-cent Waterbury that's stopped at ten minutes to ten.'
<br>
When Haylocks had exhausted the resources of Mr. Edison to
<br>
amuse he returned for his valise. And then down Broadway he gallivanted,
<br>
 culling the sights with his eager blue eyes. But still and
 <br>
evermore Broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic
<br>
smiles. He was the oldest of the 'gags' that the city must endure.
<br>
He was so flagrantly impossible, so ultra-rustic, 
<br>so exaggerated
beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard,
<br> the hayfield
and the vaudeville stage, 
<br>that he excited only weariness and suspicion. 
<br>And the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine, 
<br>so fresh and
redolent of the meadows, so clamorously rural,
<br> that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded
<br> his table at the
sight of it.
<br>
Haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once
<br>
more exhumed his roll of yellow-backs from the valise. 
<br>The outer one, a twenty, he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy.
<br>
'Son,' said he, 'run somewhere and get this changed for me. 
<br>I'm
mighty nigh out of chicken feed; 
<br>I guess you'll get a nickel if you'll
hurry up.'
<br>
A hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy's face.
<br>
'Aw, watchert'ink! G'wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself.
<br>
Dey ain't no farm clothes yer got on. G'wan wit yer stage money.'
<br>
On a corner lounged a keen-eyed steerer for a gamblinghouse.
<br> He saw Haylocks, and his expression suddenly grew cold
and virtuous.
<br>
'Mister,' said the rural one. 'I've heard of places in this here
<br>
town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a
card at keno. 
<br>
I got $950 in this valise, and I come down from old
Ulster to see the sights.
<br> Know where a fellow could get action on
about $9 or $10? 
<br>I'm goin' to have some sport, and then maybe I'll
<br>
buy out a business of some kind.'
<br>
The steerer looked pained, and investigated a white speck on his
<br>
left forefinger nail.
'Cheese it, old man,'
<br> he murmured reproachfully. 'The Central 
<br>
Office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie.
<br>
You couldn't get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in
<br>
them Tony Pastor props. The recent Mr. Scotty from Death
<br>
Valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of Elizabethan scenery
<br>
 and mechanical accessories. Let it be skiddoo for
yours.
<br> Nay, I know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol
wagon on the ace.'
<br>
Rebuffed again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities, 
<br>
Haylocks sat upon the kerb and presented his thoughts to
hold a conference.
<br>
'It's my clothes,' said he; 'durned if it ain't. 
<br>They think I'm a
hayseed and won't have nothin' to do with me. 
<br>Nobody never
made fun of this hat in Ulster County.
<br>
 I guess if you want folks to
notice you in New York you must dress up like they do.'
<br>
So Haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake
<br>
through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line
<br>
ecstatically over the bulge in his inside pocket where reposed a red
<br>
nubbin of corn with an even number of rows. 
<br>
And messengers
bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on Broadway
<br>
within the lights of Long Acre.
<br>
At nine o'clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk
<br>
whom Ulster County would have forsworn. 
<br>
Bright tan were his
shoes; his hat the latest block. 
<br>
His light grey trousers were deeply
creased; 
<br>
a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast
<br>
pocket of his elegant English walking-coat.
<br> His collar might have
graced a laundry window; 
<br>his blond hair was trimmed close; the
wisp of hay was gone.
<br>
For an instant he stood, resplendent, 
<br>with the leisurely air of a
boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening
pleasures.
<br> And then he turned down the gay, bright street with the
<br>
easy and graceful tread of a millionaire.
<br>
But in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes
<br>
in the city had enveloped him in their field of vision. 
<br>A stout man
with grey eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows
<br>
from the row of loungers in front of the hotel.
<br>
'The juiciest jay I've seen in six months,' said the man with grey
<br>
eyes. 'Come along.'
It was half-past eleven when a man galloped into the West
<br>
Forty-seventh Street police-station with the story of his wrongs.
<br>
'Nine hundred and fifty dollars,' he gasped, 'all my share of
grandmother's farm.'
<br>
The desk sergeant wrung from him the name Jabez Bulltongue,
<br>
of Locust Valley Farm, Ulster County, and then began to take
<br>
descriptions of the strong-arm gentlemen.
<br>
When Conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem,
<br>
he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner
<br>
office that is decorated with the statuettes by Rodin and J. G.
Brown.
