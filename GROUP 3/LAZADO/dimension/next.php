	echo  " “Hey, you wanna come with me to the book store? I’m gonna check on that book you recommended me.” Anthony says excited. “Wish I could, I have cheer dance practice in 20 minutes ‘cause we’re going to a basketball game tomorrow to cheer for the school team.” Megan replies, frowning. “Oh, don’t worry about it. Besides, it is what you love.” Anthony replies smiling. “Thanks, Tony.” she says, smiling. Anthony drives toward the book store to check on the book that Megan had shown him. He was very excited to see the book. As a book lover, his heart raced quickly as he got nearer to the store. Upon reaching the book store, his smile turns into a frown as he sees a sign that’s read: A Winter’s Promise: ALL SOLD OUT. Please come back next week for the next batch. “Whoa.” he exclaims. “Megan was right. That book was a great read it got sold out in just one whole week.” he adds. When he got home, he ran up to his room. He puts down his bag and falls on to his bed, dead tired. But the smile from before hasn’t faded yet. He looked at the photograph of him and Megan at their annual Science Fair, where he and Megan won first place. Sooner than he expected, he fell to sleep. *** The next day, Anthony receives a message that reads: “Hey!! We’re off to the game. Wish us luck!!” - Megan ‘You got this, mi amiga.’ Anthony says to himself. Some time later, Anthony sees Chelsea who happens to sit alone in the corner of the classroom. “You miss your bestie, huh?” Anthony asks as he approached Chelsea. “Yeah, but it’s only for a day anyway.” Chelsea answers, wearing a forced smile. “By the looks of it, you don’t seem comfortable with it.” “I’m fine, okay? What could go wrong?” A little while later, Chelsea sits at the cafeteria, alone and sad. Anthony approaches Chelsea and decides to stay with her for lunch. “What could go wrong, huh?” Anthony retorts. “Okay, maybe I was slightly unsure of it.” Chelsea replies, trying to laugh a little. “She’ll be back tomorrow. It’ll be alright.” Anthony says as he comforts her. Chelsea decides to change the channel of their conversation. “Hey I don’t know if you’re aware, but Megan received a book from the mail last week and it was the book she showed you yesterday.” Chelsea says. “No way?” Anthony says, surprised. “Yeah. And it’s the original copy.” Chelsea adds. “Who’s it from?” “Didn’t say who.” “Dang, that’s one heck of a gift.” Anthony remarks. “And you did good not letting her know it was from you.” Anthony nearly spat out his drink in surprise. “I’m sorry, say that again?” he replies. “I know it’s you, don’t deny it.” she says, trying to force something out of him. “Who? The writer of the book? Absolutely not.” he answers confidently. “Okay then, if you say so.” Chelsea says, trying to be satisfied with his answer. Anthony had to leave early to get to class. Chelsea was left alone with only one thought in her mind: ‘I know it’s him. I feel it in my gut.’ *** As Anthony drove home after class, the very thought of him being a writer was bothering him. ‘This is nuts. I can’t be a writer. I can’t even write an essay well, what more of a big-ass story?’ he said to 
himself. When he reached home, he received a message from Megan. “Hey!! How was your day? Text me if you receive my message :)” While Anthony was looking at the message, he received another message; this time, it was from Chelsea. “Hey. I’m sorry about my irrational judgement a while ago. Megan also told me the same thing yesterday. But it’s not to late to show her that you can excel in something more than what Brody is good at. Text me back if you can. - Chelsea” Anthony sighed. It was as if what he wanted to say faded like ash on the ground. Whatever he would say, Chelsea would always counter it with another factual statement, so he decided to say nothing at all. *** The next morning when Anthony arrived at school, he caught sight of Megan who was just down the hall. “Hey!! How was the game?” Anthony asked his friend. “We won the finals!!” Megan said, smiling. “And down to the championship we go.” added a deep voice who seemed quite unfamiliar. Then out of the corner of the hall, a fair-toned and average-heighted boy emerged from the shadows. It was Brody, the team’s MVP for two straight seasons. In his hand was a copy of the book A Winter’s Promise. Could Megan have already found the guy she had been looking for? “Oh, Brody. What are you doing here?” Anthony asked, sheepishly. “Hey ‘Tony. Just came to accompany my girl to her room. After all, I am who she’s been looking for.” Brody answered as he held her shoulder. “Megan, what’s he talking about?” Anthony asked, looking very clueless. “Anthony..” she began. “I found him.” “You found….who?” “The writer of the book. It’s Brody.” “How’d you know that?” “He told me and showed me all of his works, even the failed ones.” Megan handed Anthony a whole yellow pad full of writings. “Wow, congratulations.” Anthony said, trying to smile. “So, since you’re not so good in writing, maybe you could join us for a little tutorial session for the project we have to turn in by the last week of the semester.” Megan offered. “I’ll see later, but I can’t promise.” “Well, suit yourself. This is your only chance to pull your grades up.” Megan and Brody walked together with smiles on each other’s faces.";
