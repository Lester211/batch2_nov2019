	echo  "Anthony was left alone. He was still speechless of what had happened. Were he to feel happy that Megan had finally found the guy of her dreams? He couldn’t think.
	Or speak. He walked away and no one noticed, except for Chelsea. *** As soon as classes had finished, he headed to his car with his head hanging down.
	Chelsea saw and knew why he was like that. She approached Anthony and decided to talk to him. He started his car and closed the door.
	She knocked at his window and Anthony rolled it down. The frown was still fresh on his face. Anthony was still left breathless.
	He couldn’t seem to think or do something at the moment. It was as if he was taken into a room of darkness, full of misery and hopelessness. 
	“You know if anyone should be sad, it’s me.” Chelsea retorted. “Why? What did you do?” Anthony asked curiously.
	“I’ve been believing that you were the writer from the very beginning, when in the end, it was Brody all along.
	” Chelsea explained. “But you’re still hanging on to that?” “Nah. I might get into even more trouble with Megan.
	” Chelsea said, sadly. “Maybe you could still hang onto it, just for a little while longer.” Anthony pleaded before he drove away.
	Chelsea felt helpless as she watched Anthony’s car pull out from the lot and out on to the busy streets.
	*** When Anthony reached home, he went up to his room and sat on his desk. He sat there, staring at nothing as darkness came upon him, as if it were to swallow him whole.
	When he went to work on the project Megan mentioned to him, he noticed a whole yellow pad that he had gone missing.
	“No.” Anthony said, worried. ‘It can’t be. Where is it?’ he said to himself. He went through everything in his room.
	He checked his small table by his bed, his drawers, his closet. He was so desperate, he wanted to empty out the whole house just to find it.
	Then, a memory flashed. He remembered the yellow pad that Brody held in his hand.
	Could that yellow pad belong to Anthony and Brody just used it to impress Megan and make her believe that she has actually found her favorite writer? *** Back in the quaint village were Megan resided, she entered the house with a smile on her face. “Hi Mom, I’m home!!” she said, happily. “Wow!! You’re happy today, what’s up?” her mom asked while preparing dinner.
	“I found him at last.” “Who? The sender?” “Yeah!! It was Brody all along.” “Brody? Who’s Brody?” her mom asked. “He’s the school’s MVP for two straight seasons. Megan replied. “Wow, an athlete and a writer, huh?” “Not to mention he’s also great in class.” “Even better than Anthony?” Megan stopped and looked at her mom. “What do you mean?” Megan asked.
	“I mean, does this mean Brody’s better than Anthony in school?” her mom asked. “Technically yes, ‘cause Anthony’s always late in school and always turns in his paper works later than the specified deadline.” Megan explained. “Hm. I see.” “Yeah.” Megan’s mom looks at her with a sincere face. “You know, your father wasn’t whom I expected him to be.” she began.
	“Why?” she asked. “He wasn’t, well, as handsome as I expected.” Megan was teary-eyed. She never talked about this with her daughter. Megan’s father went to work one day and ever since, became missing. A week after that, he was reported dead after being shot. “How does this connect to Anthony?
	” Megan asked. “Anthony is the one, and I know it for sure.” her mom replied. “You sound just like Chelsea.” Megan’s mom saw Megan’s bag open, with the yellow pad she received from Brody. “May I see that yellow pad?” her mom asked. “Sure, Mom.” Upon taking a quick glance at the pad, Megan’s mom had an idea.
	“Honey, do you still remember where you put all the letters Anthony had given to you last Valentines’ Day?” her mom asked. “Yeah, they’re in my drawer. 
	Why?” Megan asked, looking curious. “Could you get them for me?” “Uhm, sure.” Megan ran up to her room and got the longest letter Anthony had given to her last Valentines’ Day. When she reached downstairs, they went to the dining table and turned on the lights. They compared the writings of the yellow pad and on the letter. Megan was so surprised her eyes could pop out. “They’re–“ “The same, right?
	” “Y-Yeah.” Megan stuttered. She couldn’t believe what she had seen. “HHow did you know about this?” Megan asked again.
	“Mothers always know best.” she answered and gave Megan a wink. “And I have my sources.” she added. Deep inside, Megan still had a hint of doubt. What if he just copied it from Brody?” ";
