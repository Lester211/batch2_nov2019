out how she would react. “Oh, you. What are you doing here?” she asked, her voice cracking out from crying. “Just wanted to check if you were doing alright.” Anthony said, smiling. Megan sniffled and sighed as Anthony handed over his tissue pack. “You’re probably still mad at me for making such an irrational judgement with asking you first, right?” she asked, sobbing. “Megan, you know me; I don’t hold grudges….even to those who hurt me the most sometimes.” Anthony replied, smiling. Megan sniffled and smiled at him. “Thanks, Tony.” she said. “Now, come on!! Stop that crying and you’re turning 18 tomorrow!!” Chelsea remarked joyfully. “My birthday? Oh my God!! My debut’s this Friday at Acacia Hotel!!” Megan exclaimed. “Oh yeah that’s right!!” Anthony and Chelsea said, surprised. “I gotta go and get my outfit prepped. It’s already Wednesday and my event’s this Friday!!” “Not to worry you, but April 9’s a holiday, which is this Friday.” Anthony remarked. “Which means more people.” Chelsea added. “Not to mention the traffic, too.” Anthony added as well. Megan hurriedly went to her car. But before she drove away, she looked back at Anthony. “Hey, Tony?” she asked, sounding a bit scared. “Yeah, what’s up?” he answered. “I know we fought a while ago and all those stuff I said about you but, would you want to be one of my 18 roses on my debut?” she asked, trying to smile. “Want? I’d be honored to!!” he exclaimed happily. “Great!! The title of my debut is “A Crystallised Masquerade Celebration: Megan at 18” which is a sparkle-and-shine-themed party and the party goers are expected to go in masks. So as much as possible, wear shining or bright colors like white, silver and others.” she explained while handing out the invitations. “Reminiscing the 1800’s, eh? Sounds classy.” Chelsea said, impressed. “I bet you’re gonna ‘shimmer and sparkle’ the night away.” Anthony said, smiling. “Oh, Anthony stop it.” Megan giggled. Megan couldn’t help but blush. As soon as she left, Chelsea looked at Anthony who had a smile that was bigger than before. “Looks like you got yourself a one-way confession ticket, Tony.” Chelsea smiled. “Well, it’s now or never.” Anthony said as he clutched his backpack towards him. “What are you planning to give her?” “I don’t know. Maybe another book?” “You can’t write a book in one and a half days.” Anthony stopped for a moment. He knew Chelsea had a point. This might be his last chance to make things right after Megan had proven him wrong. He texted his parents to rent him a coat and tie for the debut and they immediately did. They texted him that it was in his closet and he took note of that. The three friends parted ways as they all headed home to prepare for Megan’s debut. *** As Anthony’s car pulled over into the garage, he went up to his room to find the coat and tie left by his parents. He found the coat bag in his closet with a note that read: “Green is the color of will, as said in the Green Lantern film. You must be courageous and have a lot of willpower to admit to her that you are the one. And I know you posses both of those qualities. Go get her, son!! Make me and your mom proud!! We’ll be back in a week. We love you!!” - Dad When he took out the suit, it was an emerald-colored coat and tie. Anthony was speechless. ’This is it. The time has come for my big reveal.’ Anthony said to himself. ‘It’ll take all my powers to stand up there and tell her the truth.’ he added. Suddenly his MacBook popped up a notification from Skype. It was Chelsea, who wanted to have a video call. Anthony decided to answer the call. “Hey Tony!!” Chelsea greeted, smiling. “Chel, what’s up?” Anthony asked. “Just checking up on you.” Suddenly, another voice comes from the call. “Is that–“ “Hi Anthony!!” Megan called out from the call. “Megan!!” he exclaimed. “Surprised? Me and Chelsea are at the gown rentals, checking on gowns for Friday.” she asked. “Oh, I see.” “Hey, which looks better? Blue or violet for my gown?” Megan asked. “I think blue looks great on you.” Anthony answered confidently. “How come?” Chelsea asked, intrigued. “From a comic strip that I used to read, which is about DC’s Various Lantern Corps, blue is the color of hope.” he explained. “Wow, that sounds great!! All right, I’ll take blue. What about you, Chel?” Megan asked her best friend. “Hm, I might go with….indigo. I love indigo so much.” Chelsea answered, while clutching the dress. “I can tell, right Anthony?” Megan asked Anthony, who was chuckling a little. “Absolutely.” he replied. Anthony checked his watch. It was way past his bedtime. He bid the two friends goodbye and ended the call. *** The next day, Anthony received an announcement from their class president that the teachers had a conference to attend to, which means there wouldn’t be any classes for the day. ‘Two-day rest day means time for preparations.’ Anthony said to himself. He intended to give Megan the best gift he could ever give. Was it flowers? Chocolates? A new book? He couldn’t decide. Luckily, he had some amount in his debit card to spend for her birthday. ‘Time to put my spending to some good use today.’ he told himself as he prepared to buy Megan the best present ever since being 18 only happens once in a girl’s life. He started his car and headed to the nearby mall to check out some supplies he might need for making a great present. He went to the bookstore to check on something he had been willing to read for quite a while. He also bought some pens and papers for the gift. He headed to the checkout counter to pay for all the materials and the book. When he finished, he had lunch and unexpectedly bumped into Chelsea. “Chelsea!!” he exclaimed, with his eyes popped wide. “Shh!! Keep it down!!” she said, shushing him. “What? Are you robbing the store or something?” he joked. Chelsea looked at Anthony blankly. They took off to a corner nearby. Anthony took off Chelsea’s hand that happened to cover his mouth. “What was that for?” he asked, annoyed. “Okay, first of all, I wasn’t stealing anything and second, Megan is with me, checking out on new earrings for her debut tomorrow.” Chelsea answered. “It’s not like she’ll suspect or something.” he remarked. Just then, Megan caught sight of Anthony. He had run out of excuses to leave quickly, until all of a sudden. “Hey Megan!! Great to see you!! Listen, I gotta go, I really need to use the bathroom. Catch you later!!” he said quickly, as he dashed away like lightning. Megan looked at Chelsea. She couldn’t comprehend what had just happened. “What was that about? Did he have to do the pee or poop?” Megan asked, 
confused. Chelsea just shrugged her shoulders. *** Friday Night. The big debut of Megan. Anthony had just finished wrapping Megan’s present. His smile was so bright, it turned his dark and gloomy room into a room full of happiness and joy. As he strapped on his necktie, he looked at his reflection confidently. ‘No turning back now….it’s showtime.’ he said to himself. He checked his watch and saw that it was 30 minutes before the party. He was right on schedule. As soon as he reached the venue, he saw how elegant and well prepared the celebration was. At the lobby, he caught sight of Chelsea who was looking very splendid in her indigo dress along with her bright yellow-green mask. She couldn’t recognize him at first, but it didn’t take long for her to see that it was Anthony behind the silver-coated mask. “Well, if it isn’t the Emerald Gentleman.” Chelsea remarked, impressed. “Not bad yourself.” he remarked back. Nearby, there was a photo shoot going on. It was a girl in a deep blue gown with a jet black mask. Anthony couldn’t believe his eyes. He was left jaw-dropped. Chelsea noticed from behind. “Beautiful, isn’t she?” Chelsea retorted. “And I’m the fifth boy to dance with her tonight.” Anthony remarked, sounding a bit scared. “I don’t think I’m ready yet. What if she won’t believe me? What if I lose the chance? What if I–“ “Relax.” Chelsea said, patting his shoulder .<br />";
