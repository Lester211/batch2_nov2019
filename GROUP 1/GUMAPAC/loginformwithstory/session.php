<input type="hidden" name="name" value="<center>Turin, Republic of Padania, 11 August 2032.
The frames of the French window squalled like a baby as the
handle turned. I pushed it gently. It opened without further complaint.
Nothing stirred in the street below or behind the windows opposite. I
stepped on to the small balcony now bare of plants and lifted my face to
the soft rain.
I’d always liked August in Turin. It used to be the only time you
could find a place to park within strolling distance of where you lived. As
you strolled, you could look up at the buildings – there’s always a detail
to make the effort worthwhile – without bumping into your neighbours or
coating your shoes with evidence that they kept dogs. On the other hand,
you had to look hard to find shops that were open for business. Well, that
hasn’t changed much, but back then (twenty years ago) the reason was
that the shop-keepers and their customers were leathering their skins on
the Adriatic coast or chilling out in the mountains. Today, the sea is
another country, and they cannot afford to go to the mountains.
The fresh, uncontaminated rain felt good and clean. I shook enough
out of my eyes so that I could focus on the hospice opposite. It was not a
pretty sight: opaque rectangular windows set in a featureless light brown
façade. I mulled over the rumours about what was being done to the
people inside and decided the rumours might be true. My stomach told
me I couldn’t stay here much longer. One more year. If I could hold
together just one more year, if things around me didn’t fall even further
towards the Greenshirts’ idea of paradise, I could collect my meagre
pension and join Carmen in Italy. That would be a fine thing. But I’d miss
the Turin rain, 
 
        The purr of the phone called me back inside. I switched it to soundonly and answered. A voice spoke to me in English. I answered in Italian,
trying to inflect it with the local lilt, until I heard the name Daria. She was
the caller I’d been waiting for. We arranged to meet in ten minutes. I
hung up the phone, then took my outdoor gear off the hook next to it. As I
struggled into my light blue smock, I tried to work out the quickest route
to the Botanical Gardens. They were close.
In the street, I felt awkward and exposed, like a shepherd in a
metropolis. At least the United Nations insignia would give more
protection than my white skin alone could guarantee. My car gleamed in
the rain. I got in and eased it down the narrow one-way street. As usual,
traffic was sparse.
I followed the road works for the second underground line, then
turned left in front of the baroque palace that housed the Faculty of
Padanian Architecture. Something about it didn't seem right, but I
couldn't put my finger on what it was. I parked in the shelter of some
heavy oak trees, pulled from the glove compartment a supermarket bag
that was bulging with hard currency, got out and locked the door. Pure
force of habit: no-one would risk a twenty-year sentence for a nine-yearold Bulgarian Solaris. A short, stocky woman stood opposite, just outside
the entrance to the Gardens. She was dressed in a green mock-sari
emblazoned with a jagged blood-coloured cross. Her lustrous brown hair
was streaked with artificial grey. She was alone. The city’s parks were
safe for women on their own, provided they had the right clothes, skin
colour and accent. This one, Daria Rigoletti, had given herself all of
those. Her steely eyes looked me up and down disapprovingly as I
approached.
“Bôn dì,” she said., 
“Cerea,” I answered – a standard greeting routine in the local
dialect and our agreed passwords. She switched effortlessly to English.
“I have the goods.”
From a fold in her mock-sari, she took out a large white envelope
and offered it to me.
“Please check.”
I lodged the supermarket bag under my left shoulder, feigning
casualness, slipped out the two British passports, checked the photos, the
personal details, the Padanian exit and re-entry visas, and the entry visas
for England. It all seemed right. I checked again, going carefully over
each detail on every page. The woman waited patiently.
“OK,” I said finally.
I pushed the passports into the envelope, took the bag from under
my arm and handed it to Daria.
“As agreed, ten thousand new euros. Cheap at the price, if I may
say so. Perhaps you’d like to count it in my car.”
“That won’t be necessary.”
My face must have registered surprise. She laughed shortly.
“Change of plan.”
“What do you mean?”
“New terms. You don’t pay. You just do us a favour.”
“What favour?”
She laughed again, but there was no amusement in her eyes. “We
haven’t thought about it yet. If and when we do, we’ll let you know.”
It seemed a strange deal to me, but I wasn’t going to argue. I didn’t
have time. I put the bag back under my arm. That was when I noticed
what was wrong with the building. From this angle you could see that a
narrow swathe had been cut right through the middle. Two imposing
long-reach excavators - 'Godzillas' they call them here - were standing">
