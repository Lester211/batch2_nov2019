	  	  "I am dead, but it’s not so bad. I’ve learned to live with it. I’m sorry I can’t properly introduce myself, 
	  but I don’t have a name any more. Hardly any of us do. We lose them like car keys, forget them like anniversaries. 
	  Mine might have started with an ‘R’, but that’s all I have now. It’s funny because back when I was alive, I was always 
	  forgetting other people’s names. My friend ‘M’ says the irony of being a zombie is that everything is funny, but you can’t smile,
	  because your lips have rotted off. None of us are particularly attractive, but death has been kinder to me than some. I’m still in 
	  the early stages of decay. Just the grey skin, the unpleasant smell, the dark circles under my eyes. I could almost pass for a Living
	  man in need of a vacation. Before I became a zombie I must have been a businessman, a banker or broker or some young temp learning the 
	  ropes, because I’m wearing fairly nice clothes. Black slacks, grey shirt, red tie. M makes fun of me sometimes. He points at my tie and 
	  tries to laugh, a choked, gurgling rumble deep in his gut. His clothes are holey jeans and a plain white T-shirt. The shirt is looking
	  pretty macabre by now. He should have picked a darker colour. We like to joke and speculate about our clothes, since these final fashion
	  choices are the only indication of who we were before we became no one. Some are less obvious than mine: shorts and a sweater, skirt and a blouse.
	  So we make random guesses. You were a waitress. You were a student. Ring anybells? It never does. No one I know has any specific memories. 
	  Just a vague, vestigial knowledge of a world long gone. Faint impressions of past lives that linger like phantom limbs. 
	  We recognise civilisation  buildings, cars, a general overview – but we have no personal role in it. No history. 
	  We are just here. We do what we do, time passes, and no one asks questions. But like I’ve said, it’s not so bad. 
	  We may appear mindless, but we aren’t. The rusty cogs of cogency still spin, just geared down and down till the outer motion 
	  is barely visible. We grunt and groan, we shrug and nod, and sometimes a few words slip out. It’s not that different from before.
	  But it does make me sad that we’ve forgotten our names. Out of everything, this seems to me the most tragic. 
	  I miss my own and I mourn for everyone else’s, because I’d like to love them, but I don’t know who they are. 
	  There are hundreds of us living in an abandoned airport outside some large city. We don’t needshelter or warmth, obviously, 
	  but we like having the walls and roofs over our heads. Otherwise we’d just be wandering in an open field of dust somewhere,
	  and that would be strangely horrific. To have nothing at all around us, nothing to touch or look at, no hard lines whatsoever,
	  just us and the gaping maw of the sky. I imagine that’s what being full-dead is like. An emptiness vast and absolute. I think we’ve been here a long time. I still have all my flesh, but there are elders who are little
more than skeletons with clinging bits of muscle, dry as jerky. Somehow it still extends and contracts,
and they keep moving. I have never seen any of us ‘die’ of old age. Maybe we live for ever, I don’t know.
The future is as blurry to me as the past. I can’t seem to make myself care about anything to the right or
left of the present, and the present isn’t exactly urgent. You might say death has relaxed me. I am riding
the escalators when M finds me. I ride the escalators several times a day, whenever they move. It’s become
a ritual. The airport is derelict, but the power still flickers on sometimes, maybe flowing from emergency
generators stuttering deep underground. Lights flash and screens blink, machines jolt into motion. I cherish
these moments. The feeling of things coming to life. I stand on the steps and ascend like a soul into Heaven,
that sugary dream of our childhoods, now a tasteless joke. After maybe thirty repetitions, I rise to find M
waiting for me at the top. He is hundreds of pounds of muscle and fat draped on a six-foot-five frame. Bearded,
bald, bruised and rotten, his grisly visage slides into view as I crest the staircase summit. Is he the angel
that greets me at the gates? His ragged mouth is oozing black drool. He points in a vague direction and grunts,
‘City.’ I nod and follow him. We are going out to find food. A hunting party forms around us as we shuffle towards town.
It’s not hard to find recruits for these expeditions, even if no one is hungry. Focused thought is a rare occurrence here,
and we all follow it when it manifests. Otherwise we’d just be standing around and groaning all day. We do a lot of standing
around and groaning. Years pass this way. The flesh withers on our bones and we stand here, waiting for it to go. I often
wonder how old I am. The city where we do our hunting is conveniently close. We arrive around noon the next day and start
looking for flesh. The new hunger is a strange feeling. We don’t feel it in our stomachs – some of us don’t even have those.
We feel it everywhere equally, a sinking, sagging sensation, as if our cells are deflating. Last winter, when so many Living
joined the Dead and our prey became scarce, I watched some of my friends become full-dead. The transition was undramatic.
They just slowed down, then stopped, and after a while I realised they were corpses. It disquieted me at first, but it’s
against etiquette to notice when one of us dies. I distracted myself with some groaning. I think the world has mostly ended,
because the cities we wander through are as rotten as we are. Buildings have collapsed. Rusted cars clog the streets. Most glass
is shattered, and the wind drifting through the hollow high-rises moans like an animal left to die. I don’t know what happened.
Disease? War? Social collapse? Or was it just us? The Dead replacing the Living? I guess it’s not so important. Once you’ve arrived
at the the end of the world, it hardly matters which route you took. We start to smell the Living as we approach a dilapidated
apartment building. The smell is not the musk of sweat and skin, but the effervescence of life energy, like the ionised tang of
lightning and lavender. We don’t smell it in our noses. It hits us deeper inside, near our brains, like wasabi. We converge on
the building and crash our way inside. We find them huddled in a small studio unit with the windows boarded up. They are dressed
worse than we are, wrapped in filthy tatters and rags, all of them badly in need of a shave. M will be saddled with a short blond
beard for the rest of his Fleshy existence, but everyone else in our party is clean-shaven. It’s one of the perks of being Dead,
another thing we don’t have to worry about any more. Beards, hair, toenails, no more fighting biology. Our wild bodies have
finally been tamed. Slow and clumsy but with unswerving commitment, we launch ourselves at the Living. Shotgun blasts fill the
dusty air with gunpowder and gore. Black blood spatters the walls. The loss of an arm, a leg, aportion of torso, this is disregarded,
shrugged off. A minor cosmetic issue. But some of us take shots to our brains, and we drop. Apparently there’s still something of
value in that withered grey sponge, because if we lose it, we are corpses. The zombies to my left and right hit the ground with moist
thuds. But there are plenty of us. We are overwhelming. We set upon the Living, and we eat. Eating is not a pleasant business.
I chew off a man’s arm, and I hate it. I hate his screams, because I don’t like pain, I don’t like hurting people, but this is the world now.
This is what we do. Of course if I don’t eat all of him, if I spare his brain, he’ll rise up and follow me back to the airport, and that might
make me feel better. I’ll introduce him to everyone, and maybe we’ll stand around and groan for a while. It’s hard to say what ‘friends’ are
any more, but that might be close. If I restrain myself, if I leave enough . . . But I don’t. I can’t. As always I go straight for the good part,
the part that makes my head light up like a picture tube. I eat the brain and, for about thirty seconds, I have memories. Flashes of parades,
perfume, music life. Then it fades, and I get up, and we all stumble out of the city, still cold and grey,but feeling a little better.
Not ‘good’, exactly, not ‘happy’, certainly not ‘alive’, but  a little less dead. This is the best we can do. ",
